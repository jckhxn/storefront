# A basic overview of your site.

Customers can view products on the front page.  You can select products and add to the cart (also shown at the upper right) and proceed to checkout.  If they are not already logged in they are prompted to do so, or register for an account.
Once doing so they enter their shipping address, select PayPal and continue.
PayPal can handle debit or credit cards without the need for them having an account if needbe. 

You will receive an invoice from PayPal that an order has been placed.  Orders that have been placed can be viewed after logging
in yourself into the site and clicking Admin -> Orders.
You will see order information, including their name and a link to view details.
Details will supply you with what was purchased, a contact email or name (gathered from the order process) and address.


# Admin User panel.
Clicking your name next to the word "Admin" will allow you to change your name, email, and password in the system.
This is also where customers can do the same as well as view their previous orders.


# Adding Products.
You can add products by clicking login -> entering your credentials -> clicking admin and then products.
Items can also be searched for from the front page.


There will be a list of products and a Create Product button.
Clicking Create will provide you fields to enter the information you like, any photo you upload is handled by the server.

There will be an option to edit or delete any existing product.

If you run into trouble for any reason give the page a refresh and that should clear up anything that might've goofed up,
otherwise let me know and I'll give it a good talking to lol.
